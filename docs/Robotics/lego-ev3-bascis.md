# LEGO EV3 

## Imaging MicroPython
To program the LEGO EV3's we will be using MicroPython. The MicroSD cards have already been prepared. If there is an issue with the MicroSD they can be re-imaged using these [instructions](https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/startinstall.html). You can read the full documentation and what some of the possibilities with the LEGO EV3s [here](https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/).

## PC Setup
You will need to have installed on your PC [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and the [EV3 MicroPython](https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/startinstall.html#preparing-your-computer) extension.

!!! Note
    I have had more success with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) as Etcher was corrupting the MicroSD and required a full reformat of the card to fix.

## Getting Started
Follow these [instructions](https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/startbrick.html) to get started with the MicroPython MicroSD card.
