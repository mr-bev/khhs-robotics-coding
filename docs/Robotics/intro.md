# Introduction

Robot come in all shapes and sizes. We try different technologies like micro:bit, lego, arduino and Raspberry Pi to see which ones are easy to work with and what are their strengths and limitations. Types of robots we can try build are the line and rescue robots used for [RoboCup Junior Australia](https://www.robocupjunior.org.au/), the robots built for the [First Lego League Challenge](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/events) or [VEX Robotics Competitions](https://www.vexrobotics.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopPP8GXukgmygEiLUiIu1Rw8m69MaSgwzbkO3ln-J-0OC2rtInV)
